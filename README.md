### Welcome to Tengyu Liu's Homepage

I am a Computer Science master student at UCLA. My research interest is in machine learning and computer vision. I am currently working with [VCLA (Center for Vision, Cognition, Learning, and Autonomy)](http://vcla.stat.ucla.edu/people.html) under the supervision of Professor Song-Chun Zhu. 

Before joining UCLA I received my bachelors degree in Computer Science from UIUC in 2015.
